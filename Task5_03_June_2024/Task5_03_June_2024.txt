In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are different objects that represent distinct aspects of a web page and the browser environment. Let's explore each of them with examples:

1. window:
   - The window object represents the browser window or a tab in which the web page is loaded.
   - It is the global object in a web browser and provides access to the browser's APIs and properties.
   - Example:

     // Accessing window properties
     console.log(window.innerWidth); // Width of the browser window
     console.log(window.innerHeight); // Height of the browser window

     // Opening a new window
     window.open("https://www.example.com");
  

2. Screen:
   - The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor.
   - It provides information about the user's display, such as screen size, color depth, and available resolution.
   - Example:
   
     // Accessing screen properties
     console.log(screen.width); // Total width of the user's screen
     console.log(screen.height); // Total height of the user's screen
     console.log(screen.colorDepth); // Color depth of the user's screen
 

3. Document:
   - The document object represents the web page itself and is a part of the window object.
   - It provides methods and properties to manipulate and interact with the HTML structure, content, and styling of the web page.
   - Example:
  
     // Accessing document properties
     console.log(document.title); // Title of the web page
     console.log(document.URL); // URL of the web page

     // Modifying the content of an element
     document.getElementById("myElement").textContent = "Hello, World!";

     // Changing the style of an element
     document.getElementById("myElement").style.color = "red";


To summarize:
- The window object represents the browser window or tab and provides access to browser APIs and properties.
- The screen object represents the user's physical screen or monitor and provides information about the display properties.
- The document object represents the web page itself and allows manipulation and interaction with the HTML structure, content, and styling.

These objects are part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Browser Object Model (BOM) in JavaScript, providing developers with the ability to interact with the web page and the browser environment.
