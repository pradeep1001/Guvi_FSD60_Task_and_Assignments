1) Find all the information about each products 
db.product.find({},{product_name : 1,product_price : 1,product_material : 1,product_color : 1, _id:1})

2)Find the product price which are between 400 to 800
db.product.find({
  product_price: {
    $gte: 400,
    $lte: 800
  }
})

3)Find the product price which are not between 400 to 600
db.product.find({
  $or: [
    { product_price: { $lt: 400 } },
    { product_price: { $gt: 600 } }
  ]
})


4)List the four product which are greater than 500 in price
db.product.find({
  product_price: {
    $gt: 500
  }
})

5)Find the product name and product material of each products
db.product.find({},{product_name : 1,product_material : 1})

6) Find the product with a row id of 10
  db.product.find({_id: "10"})
  
7)Find only the product name and product material
db.product.find({}, {_id: 0, product_name: 1, product_material: 1})

8)Find all products which contain the value of soft in product material
 db.product.find({product_material:{$in:["Soft"]}})
 
9)Find products which contain product color indigo and product price 492.00

db.product.find({
  $and: [
    { product_price: { $eq: 492 } },
    { product_color: { $in: ["indigo"] } }
  ]
})

Result: it returns no data since no Product has a price of 492.00

Instead if we use the below query, it would

a) return products which has color as  indigo
b)  also returns a product with product_price as $492, but there is no product which satisfies both the condition.
 
db.product.find({ $or: [ { product_price: { $eq: 492 } }, { product_color: "indigo" } ] })

10) Delete the products which product price value are 28

db.product.deleteMany({product_price: { $eq: 28 }})
